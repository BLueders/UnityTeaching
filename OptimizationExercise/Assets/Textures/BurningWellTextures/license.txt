How may I use the images in the BurningWell repository?

The images in the BurningWell repository are in the public domain. Basically, 
this means that you are allowed to use the images freely for any purpose,
commercial or private. You do not have to pay to use them, or even acknowledge
or give credit to the BurningWell repository or original photographer (unless you
are feeling generous).

When recognizable people appear in any of the images, the photographers have
obtained a "model release" and assigned all rights to the public domain. This
allows the images to be used in any manner, including advertising.
